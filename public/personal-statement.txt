Hi! Thanks for stopping by. 
I am a software developer with 3.5 years of full-time professional experience building web applications in the federal space. I started my career as a front-end developer and continue to hold a deep interest in modern ui/ux. This website was built using React/next.js with full mobile responsivity in mind. 
For the past year and a half, I have been working as a full-stack developer on a deployed enterprise web application with microservie architecture in the AWS Cloud with a modern tech stack and CI/CD pipeline. I had the chance to build, enhance, and maintain features from the ground up i.e. from db calls to api design to ui implementation. I have a proven track record of learning, adapting, and delivering on the job, and I am very much interested in continuing down the path of modern full-stack development. 
I'm currently working on porting some of my personal projects over to this website. In the meantime, feel free to click around and browse my credentials. Please reach out for any additional resources should you be interested in working together. 
Cheers!
