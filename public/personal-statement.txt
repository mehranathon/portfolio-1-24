Hi! Thanks for stopping by. 
I am a software developer with 3.5 years of full-time professional experience building web applications in the federal space. I started my career as a front-end developer and continue to hold a deep interest in modern ui/ux. This website was built using React/next.js, and I have a little over 2 years of professional experience working on React apps. 
For the past year and a half, I have been working as a full-stack developer on a deployed enterprise web application with microservie architecture in the AWS Cloud with a modern tech stack and CI/CD pipeline. I had the chance to build, enhance, and maintain features from the ground up i.e. from db calls to api design to ui implementation. 
My career as a developer has been defined by getting thrown into the deep end and picking up new technologies on the go. In other words, I have a proven track record of learning, adapting, and delivering on the job. I'm not afraid to ask for help, though I am very much self-taught and self-motivated. I am eager for feedback and direction but fully capable of shipping quality products and features independently. 
I'm currently working on porting some of my personal projects over to this website. In the meantime, feel free to click around and browse my credentials. Please reach out for any additional resources should you be interested in working together. 
Cheers!
