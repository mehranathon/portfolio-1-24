## About

This is the source code for my over-engineered personal page. In truth, it’s the kind of website that could be served as a static html file with some nominal styling. However, since (a) that’s not the sort of thing that flies in modern web development, and (b) I can’t link my work for the federal government, it’s an opportunity to showcase some of my frontend skills on an app I could knock out quickly. Also, I like geeking out on ui.

The application was bootstrapped using create-next-app with the next.js app router and mui v5 icon set. Of note, there are a few things on display:
- Implementation of core react concepts: leveraging functional components, hooks, callbacks, understanding of the render cycle and virtual dom
- Concise usage of ES6 syntax
- Routing with the next.js appRouter
- Global context with reducers analogous to redux; redux itself apparently has some issues with next.js
- Full responsivity/mobile-first design: responsive @ 320px+
- Usage of local and session storage
- Modern ui/ux with components built from scratch i.e. advanced understanding of CSS and HTML with some js sprinkled in
- Leveraging type safe data structures rather than hardcoding; see skills.js and workHistory.js
- Code hygiene
- Git revisioning with documentation: feature branch --> PR --> dev --> main
- Feel good user experience

Stay tuned for more!
